## Technology & Design Choices üõ†Ô∏è

* **React:** The core library used for building the user interface. Components, state management (`useState`), and effects (`useEffect`) were used to create a dynamic user experience.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for all styling. I chose Tailwind CSS because it is a utility-first framework that significantly speeds up development. It allows me to style components directly within the JSX, which avoids the context-switching of moving between component files and separate CSS files, leading to a more streamlined workflow.
* **Lucide React:** For clean and lightweight icons.
